## Introduction

[Samproxy](https://github.com/honeycombio/samproxy) is a proxy from [Honeycomb](https://www.honeycomb.io) which offers trace-aware sampling.

This module contains the Terraform infrastructure code that creates the required AWS resources to run [Samproxy](https://github.com/honeycombio/samproxy) in AWS, including the following:

- A **V**irtual **P**rivate **C**loud (VPC)
- A SSL certificate using **A**mazon **C**ertificate **M**anager (ACM)
- An **A**pplication **L**oad **B**alancer (ALB)
- A DNS Record using AWS Route53 which points to ALB
- An [AWS **E**lastic **C**loud **S**ervice (ECS)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) Cluster leveraging Spot [AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/) to run the Samproxy Docker image
- Two Parameters in [AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html) to store the Samproxy configuration and rules and access them natively in Fargate
- A single-node Redis (cluster mode disabled) Cluster in [AWS ElastiCache](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/) to be used by Samproxy for high-availability and peer discovery

![Diagram showing the architecure. The Honeycomb-instrumented apps use Route53 to connect to the ALB. The ALB routes traffic to samproxy containers running in Fargate, in different AZs and public subnets. The Samproxy containers connect to a single-AZ Redis and communicate between them.](./assets/diagram.svg)

## Gotchas

Due to Fargate on ECS having [no support for configuration files](https://github.com/aws/containers-roadmap/issues/56), the configuration is Base64-encoded, stored in [AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html), and then put in the Container Secrets. When Samproxy starts, it decodes the secret and creates the config file on disk. This leads to two limitations:

- configuration files cannot be bigger than 8Kb
- a [custom image](https://github.com/vlaaaaaaad/samproxy-fargate-image) has to be used as the upstream image does not have `sh` or `base64` included

## Versions

This module requires **Terraform 0.13**.

Just like Samproxy, this module is in preview( pre-`0.1`) which means **any new release can have breaking changes**.

## Usage

### As a standalone project

Using this module as a standalone project is **only recommended for testing**.

1. Clone this github repository:

```console
$ git clone git@github.com:vlaaaaaaad/terraform-aws-fargate-samproxy.git

$ cd terraform-aws-fargate-samproxy
```

2. Copy the sample `terraform.tfvars.sample` into `terraform.tfvars` and specify the required variables there.

3. Run `terraform init` to download required providers and modules.

4. Run `terraform apply` to apply the Terraform configuration and create the required infrastructure.

5. Run `terraform output samproxy_url` to get URL where Samproxy is reachable. (Note: It may take a minute or two for the URL to become reachable the first time)

### As a Terraform module

Using this as a Terraform module allows integration with your existing Terraform configurations and pipelines.

```hcl
module "samproxy" {
  # use git to pull the module from GitHub, the latest version
  # source = "git@github.com:vlaaaaaaad/terraform-aws-fargate-samproxy.git?ref=main"
  # or
  # Pull a specific version from Terraform Module Registry
  source  = "Vlaaaaaaad/fargate-samproxy/aws"
  version = "0.0.2"

  # REQUIRED: DNS (without trailing dot)
  route53_zone_name = "example.com"

  # REQUIRED: Samproxy configs
  samproxy_sampler_configs = [
    {
      dataset_name = "_default",
      options = [
        {
          "name"  = "Sampler"
          "value" = "DeterministicSampler"
        },
        {
          "name"  = "SampleRate"
          "value" = 1
        },
      ]
    },
    {
      dataset_name = "my-test-app",
      options = [
        {
          "name"  = "Sampler"
          "value" = "DynamicSampler"
        },
        {
          "name"  = "SampleRate"
          "value" = "2"
        },
        {
          "name"  = "FieldList"
          "value" = "['app.run']"
        },
        {
          "name"  = "UseTraceLength"
          "value" = "true"
        },
        {
          "name"  = "AddSampleRateKeyToTrace"
          "value" = "true"
        },
        {
          "name"  = "AddSampleRateKeyToTraceField"
          "value" = "meta.samproxy.dynsampler_key"
        },
      ]
    },
  ]

  # Optional: override the name
  name = "samproxy"

  # Optional: customize the VPC
  azs                = ["eu-west-1a", "eu-west-1b", "eu-west-1c"]
  vpc_cidr           = "10.20.0.0/16"
  vpc_public_subnets = ["10.20.1.0/24", "10.20.2.0/24", "10.20.3.0/24"]

  # Optional: use pre-exiting ACM Certificate instead of creating and validating a new certificate
  certificate_arn = "arn:aws:acm:eu-west-1:135367859851:certificate/70e008e1-c0e1-4c7e-9670-7bb5bd4f5a84"

  # Optional: Send Samproxy logs&metrics to Honeycomb, instead of ECS&nowhere
  samproxy_logger_option   = "honeycomb"
  samproxy_logger_api_key  = "00000000000000000000000000000000"
  samproxy_metrics_option  = "honeycomb"
  samproxy_metrics_api_key = "00000000000000000000000000000000"
}
```

### As a Terraform module, as part of existing infrastructure

Using this module also allows integration with existing AWS resources -- VPC, Subnets, IAM Roles. Specify the required arguments.

> **WARNING**: This was not tested.
